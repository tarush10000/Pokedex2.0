# ðŸš€ Pokedex 2.0 - My First Flutter Project

Welcome to Pokedex 2.0, my very first Flutter project! ðŸŽ‰ This app allows user to input any photo into the application which then generates Pokedex-like stats which are saved into the device.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

Pokedex 2.0 is a Gemini API based Flutter project that takes image as an input and then provides Pokemon like stats and description for the image. The API is securely saved within the device using Flutter Secure Storage along with all the stats saved in the form of a database using SQLite. It also contains platform-specific code for implementation of Text - to - Speech across different platforms including Android (Kotlin), iOS (Swift), Windows (C++) & Linux (C++).  

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

Here's a quick overview of the tech stack used in this project:

- **Flutter:** The main framework for building the app.
- **Dart:** The programming language used.
- **SQLite (via sqflite):** For local database storage.
- **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro AI:** For performing analysis over text and image prompt
